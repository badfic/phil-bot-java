Alec Holland	170	Congratulations, <name>, you are the literal human embodiment of a swamp, aka <rolename>, aka The Swamp Thing himself.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/929937615971561513/170alexholland.gif
Shrek	171	You used to be the king of this swamp, <name>, but now you've been dethroned. Have fun being a loser as <rolename>.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/929919452231921694/shrek.gif
Cardi B	172	You're the queen of this swamp <name>! The one and only <rolename>!! Okurrr?? You used to be the queen b (as in queen booty), but now you answer to Nana.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/929919897763454996/cardi-b.gif
Nana Rose	173	Cheryl likes to pretend she invented red, but it was you, wasn't it, <rolename>? After all, <name> Nana's been around for centuries. She's outlived a hundred Eobard Thawnes. A Million. She predates colours and maybe the Earth itself. She is endless. She is eternal. Hell, she might even be the Prime Eternal. Nobody even likes Zuras's crusty ass anyway.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/929937679267823676/173nanarose.gif

Super Mega Supreme Bastard	200	Congratulations <name>! You're <rolename>. I don't know how to say this, but you've somehow become more of a chaotic swampy wench than the actual devil. Are you okay? Do you need us to call someone?	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/871326195046838272/100_supreme.gif
