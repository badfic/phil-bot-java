Boo Boo Stewart in The Grinch Musical	19	Okay so this is SPECIFICALLY <rolename>. Not the actual dog from The Grinch, who is probably named Kevin or something (his name is Max, actually).

James "Rhodey" Rhodes	25	Nelly said Gay Rights and guessed <rolename> correctly. And I just want to say, that it's finally nice to see <rolename> get the respect he deserves, <name>.

Ava Sharpe	29	This one was really difficult for y'all, but probably because it was so cursed. Thankfully, Nelly's mind is also in the gutter so we have <rolename> again!

Lucas Sinclair	30	Originally Alyssa guessed Steve for this one and I can see it, but <rolename> is by far the superior sports player and kickass hero type. Steve is the mom where Lucas is like, the actual badass here. Not to say moms can't be badass, I'm just saying <rolename> could defeat a demodog singlehanded. Which, if you think about it...kind of makes me sad because the man is 15.

I changed most of the descriptions, but Jimmy Woo is constantly living his girlboss era and this blurb reflects that.
