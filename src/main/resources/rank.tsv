Kendall Roy	81	Where's your killer instict, <name>? The only reason <rolename> made it this high on this list is because he almost drowned, tbh. Y'all know what I'm talking about.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/1071690257495498763/81kendall.gif	#017aec
Nana Rose	82	Cheryl likes to pretend she invented red, but it was you, wasn't it, <rolename>? After all, <name> Nana's been around for centuries. She's outlived a hundred Eobard Thawnes. A Million. She predates colours and maybe the Earth itself. She is endless. She is eternal. Hell, she might even be the Prime Eternal. Nobody even likes Zuras's crusty ass anyway.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/1071690258678296646/92nanarose.gif	#ff0000

Barry Allen	85	Here's what I wanna know, <name>. This motherfucker, <rolename> is supposedly the FASTEST MAN ALIVE, right? So why did he keep his wife's pee in a paper bag in his pocket for an entire day and why did Talls (capital T because of the shame. The DiSREsPECt.) write a fanfiction about it? Like, we get it, you had to fight Gods Peed for an entire series, but damn, Barry.	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/1071690258342748230/85barry.gif	#ffcd00
Super Mega Supreme Bastard	95	Congratulations <name>! You're <rolename>. I don't know how to say this, but you've somehow become more of a chaotic swampy wench than the actual devil. Are you okay?
