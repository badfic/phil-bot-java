                <b>Hello all you cool cats and kittens and welcome to The Swampys!</b><br><br>

                The Swampys are our server-wide chaos games where you can upvote or downvote people depending on a variety of factors, most of them being: because it's fun.<br><br>

                Here's how the games work: You post things that can be deemed cute, chaotic, gay, punny, simpy, swampy, a mite bastardy, or cursed for points. You might get upvoted, you might not.<br><br>

                Every message you send in the server gets you points regardless of whether you're being cursed or not, so it pays to be active. However, it pays more to upvote or downvote your fellow swampys participants.<br><br>

                If you participate in the games, the games will reward you.<br><br>

                The games have 60+ levels of fun and chaotic characters from Steve Rogers to Donald Duck to Shrek himself. You can even achieve true greatness and reach the level of UIltimate Mega Supreme Bastard if you truly apply yourself. There's no limit to how high you can go.*<br><br>

                Now, what sort of content garners an upvote or downvote, you ask?<br><br>

                Well, when someone is being particularly cursed, chaotic, or a mite bastardy, feel free to upvote them via the</p>

            <p class="swampys">You can also downvote someone with the same commands as you see fit.<br><br>

                <b>At the end of every fortnight two winners will be chosen.</b> <br><br>

                For the 18+ crowd you will be crowned <b>Bastard Supreme</b> and for the Chaos Children you will be crowned <b>Ultimate Child of Chaos</b> and you will be posted on the Swamp site under our bastard collection already in progress below!
