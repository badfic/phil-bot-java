Day 25	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829248021916418058/25.png	1000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250901842591765/25_Mick_Rory.png	Mick Rory AKA “Heatwave” has been a member of the Legends team since its inception. Though, it’s a mystery as to why he’s stuck around this long. He’s seen in the background of most scenes rolling his eyes and drinking. He somehow is the first of the team to spawn an accidental pregnancy.
Day 24	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829248017512005632/24.png	1000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250892028444692/24_Ray_Palmer.png	Ray Palmer AKA “The Atom” or “Atom” is an OG Legend that left the team in the previous year after marrying the love of his life, former baddy Nora Darhk. He’s gone off in search of greater things, though some people speculate he was “let go” to fund the Legends’ chaotic habit of “fucking around to find out”.
Day 23	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829248012882411520/23.png	1500	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250879068307466/23_Nate_Heywood.png	Nate Heywood AKA “Steel” or “Pretty” joined the team a year after their first attempt to completely fuck up the timeline. He rescued everyone from their respective time jails, where their former captain Rip Hunter placed them after the strange events following whatever the hell the first season was even about. He has a doctorate in history and an incredibly cursed love life.
Day 22	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829248004720295956/22.png	2000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250869613953054/22_Leonard_Snart.png	Leonard Snart AKA “Captain Cold” or “Snart” is the only member of the OG team to die and have it stick. Doppelgangers don’t count for shit out here in these time streets. Though his doppelganger(s) all faired better than he did and were far more gay which is the kind of tribute Leonard Snart deserves.
Day 21	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247988627013632/21.png	2000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250862757052416/21_Wally_West.png	Wally West AKA “Kid Flash” is the only speedster to be a part of the Legends team for more than 4 consecutive episodes (but somehow still not for an entire season). He really thrived in his brief time on the team after being overshadowed by Barry Allen on Team Flash for two seasons. However, in the end, he has to return to Tibet. Likely after the shame of becoming a giant Beebo lovechild with the rest of the Legends team.
Day 20	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247984314220574/20.png	2700	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250855592919050/20_Gary_Green.png	Gary Green AKA Gary Green is a former member of the Time Bureau turned apprentice to John Constantine. His character hasn’t been fleshed out much and is often left as the butt of every joke. It kind of sucks, actually
Day 19	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247979939954738/19.png	3000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250849665712168/19_Cisco_Ramon.png	Cisco Ramon AKA Vibe. Not *technically* a Legend, but could you imagine the immense amount of power he could have if he was? No longer overshadowed by Barry Allen and the shitty storylines contained in The Flash, Cisco could be free to be queer and vibe to his heart’s content. Bearing in mind he could occasionally cross paths with one of Eobard Thawne’s ten trillion time remnants.
Day 18	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247975875280926/18.png	4000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250842770538516/18_Lita.png	Lita, AKA “The Surprise Child of Mick Rory” is basically the greatest Legend of all time. She gave Charlie the pep-talk she needed to save the timeline from her sister and also doesn’t take shit from anyone. Anyways she’s just super cool and I’m glad she exists, thanks.
Day 17	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247971992141864/17.png	4000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250836718682132/17_Martin_Stein.png	Martin Stein AKA “Stein” or “½ of Firestorm” was part of the OG Legends team. He’s now retired and lives with his loving wife and daughter. He has dinner with the other half of Firestorm, Jefferson Jackson, or “Jax”, once a week. Jax’s kids call him “grandpa”
Day 16	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247968078069760/16.png	4000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250829538033725/16_Astra_Logue.png	Astra Logue AKA “That Kid from Constantine Everyone Thought Died But Whoops No She Didn’t” joined the team in the past year after escaping from hell and returning John’s soul coin to him. She kicks ass, but we haven’t been able to see her do a lot of ass kicking just yet, unless you count her curb stomping encores to the Thong Song.
Day 15	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247964206858261/15.png	5000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250823656964126/15_Kendra_Saunders.png	Kendra Saunders AKA “Hawkgirl” used to be a barista before she became a member of the OG Legends. She left after a year to presumably start a coffee shop-slash-combat training place and so she wouldn’t have to look at Ray’s forlorn face while she tries to “figure things out” with Carter. Ultimately, the two of them break up, but she’s happy making coffee and teaching people how to throw a mace at people’s heads.
Day 14	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247959983063050/14.png	5000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250814266572820/14_Ava_Sharpe.png	Ava Sharpe AKA “Sharpie” started out as the mortal enemy of The Legend’s team then whoops she lezzed everything up and fell in love with Sara Lance. Now she’s a member of the team, and probably the impromptu captain next season considering Sara’s...absence. May or may not also be in love with Zari Tarazi.
Day 13	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247955788759080/13.png	7000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250807081598976/13_Gideon.png	Gideon AKA “Sexy” is the only member of the team that can be chaotic, queer, and contain braincells all at the same time. She’s the ship’s super computer who is sometimes a cyborg sometimes human and definitely made out with the original Captain, Rip Hunter at one point, but does it really count when it happened inside your own mind? Either way, Gideon is simultaneously the smartest and the horniest legend.
Day 12	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247951301640212/12.png	7000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250802006753360/12_Jax.png	Jefferson Jackson AKA “Jax” or “½ of Firestorm”. What can we say about Jax? He’s the only valid man to ever come from the Legends team. His entire existence breathes chaos and intelligence. He gets up to all sorts of hijinks with his counterpart, Martin Stein, and when he left the team they felt that loss all the way in their souls. Nowadays he’s a husband, a father, and all around family man.
Day 11	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829248046432780288/11.png	7000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250794736975932/11_Mona_Wu.png	Mona Wu AKA “Wolfie” got her start as the beast coordinator for the Time Bureau, but in true beast herder fashion, she immediately fell in love with a Kaupe and the two ran off into the sunset. Just kidding, he got killed by shitty FBI agents and then Mona became a Kaupe and murdered the shit out of them. She writes under the Rebecca Silver Pseudonym now and is also a literary agent. She has dinner with Ray and Nora twice a week at their new townhouse in Central City and she and Nora are rumored to be Very Close.
Day 10	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247937975418880/10.png	10000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250785421426718/10_Nora_Darhk.png	Nora Darhk AKA “Fairy Godmother” actually started as a villain hell-bent on destroying the Legends. Or...well...she sort of started as a villain? Originally she was the kid of a villain then when her dad got killed by The Green Arrow after he yeeted half of team flarrow off a cliff, John Constantine showed up to save her from a demon and failed so spectacularly he may have inadvertently caused Brexit? It’s a blur, but the point is, Nora eventually comes to love the Legends due to the kindness they show her and she falls in love with ~~Mona~~ Ray Palmer and they get married where they can live happily ever after in Central City with their 9 nakey cats. A true happily ever after is there ever was one.
Day 9	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247934214307860/9.png	1000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250779277688842/9_Sara_Lance.png	Sara Lance AKA “White Canary” started as the team’s favourite freckles assassin. Now she’s become the Captain of the Waverider. Or, well, should I say co-captain. Considering she got yeeted into space by aliens the last time we saw her. Can’t really captain a ship while you’re being held captive on another vessel.
Day 8	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247930148978698/8.png	10000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250773807792158/8_Rip_Hunter.png	Rip Hunter is the OG Captain of The Waverider, the original Legend, kisser of Gideon, former of long-lasting queer teams, master of idiotic decisions. He ended up getting himself lost in time during the team’s cursed battle with Mallus, but Sara still visits him sometimes whenever she can track him down. He has a book series he writes about the legends and their adventures. Sometimes Sara suggests them for book club.
Day 7	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247926115106877/7.png	10000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250767738109962/7_Spooner_Cruz.png	Esperanza Cruz AKA “Spooner” is the newest member of the legends team. She’s searching for her mother who was taken by the same aliens that allegedly took Sara. We don’t know much about her yet, other than that she seems really chummy with Astra and likes to make weird tech. Can’t wait to meet her.
Day 6	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247922138906634/6.png	10000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250761669869588/6_John_Constantine.png	John Constantine AKA “Magic Man” was reluctant to join the legends a few years back. He’s never really been one for “teams”, or so he told Sara when she asked him to join her merry band of idiots yeeting themselves through space. Now he’s come to think of them as family, not that he’d admit that if you asked, but they helped him get his soul back and spring Astra from hell, so he’s probably gonna stick around for awhile. Maybe. You never know with John.
Day 5	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247918094680175/5.png	42000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250755479339048/5_behrad_tarazi.png	Behrad Tarazi AKA ~~”Aang”~~ “B” appeared after the Heyworld incident. He’s a laid back go-with-the-flow type of lad. Likes to bake a lot and may or may not have a secret recipe/art blog. He’s actually pretty good at drawing despite the fact that he’s allegedly in business school. In reality he galivants through time and space shooting airblasts at enemies and stopping bullets with wind. Which, if you ask us, is far more rewarding than a shitty business degree.
Day 4	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247914001563698/4.png	10000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250749409525810/4_Charlie.png	Charlie AKA “Clotho” joined the team as a shapeshifter, turned out to be a fate, helped the Legends save the world a few times then ultimately settled down to become a punk rock star in 1970s London. Arguably the best thing that ever happened to the Legends team despite her short tenure on the team. Was almost certainly in a thruple with Zari Tarazi and John Constantine. Was definitely in a very gay flirtationship with Zari Tomaz.
Day 3	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247909664522242/3.png	11000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250743620861972/3_Zari_Tomaz.png	Zari Tomaz AKA “Z1” is a sarcastic nerdy hacker who, if given the chance, would’ve married both Charlie and Amaya in a heartbeat. She’s the OG wind totem wielder and the OG Zari, the one that will always live in our hearts and in the wind totem itself. Also, like, she saved the legends team from being trapped in TV which was really cool of her considering they all forgot she existed.
Day 2	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247905155776512/2.png	12000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250737443831828/2_Zari_Tarazi.png	Zari Tarazi AKA “Z2” is the remix of Zari Tomaz. She joined the Legends team by accident after following her brother onto the time ship when she found out he was pulling some sort of con with Nate. She ended up being held captive on the Waverider for a few missions then went to France with Ava where they flirted pretty much non-stop while Sara was away then she played Juliet and the rest, as they say in the Waverider, is history.
Day 1	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829247901417865247/1.png	250000	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794506942906761226/829250732233326612/1_Amaya_Jiwe.png	Amaya Jiwe AKA “Vixen” AKA the greatest legend to ever live. Amaya joined the team in their second year, after that whole somber mess with Vandal Savage and they lost Kendra so they had to add another animal lover to the team, but what they got was more than a person who could all on the soul of animals to yeet a grown man into space by kicking him in the balls, they got a friend. Amaya is the driving force behind why the Legends survived as long as they did, she may not have been the leader in practice, but she was the leader in our hearts and that’s what matters.
