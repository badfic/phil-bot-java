                    <div class="userstuff"><p>He’s halfway through his second glass of gin when he sees her across the bar. </p><p>She’s wearing a floor length halter gown that bells out at the knees. It’s white with an opening in the front of the bodice that dips down to her navel. Her medium brown skin glows beneath the lights of the pub and her long black hair spills loose over her shoulders. </p><p>She looks so out of place dressed like that in this dive on the wrong end of town, but John isn’t complaining. Gives him something different to look at outside of the rest of these wankers. </p><p>He takes another sip of his drink, practically leering at her while she chats with her mates. John is half-pissed already so he doesn’t even blink when she meets his gaze, her red painted lips quirking upward in a mischievous grin. </p><p>John smirks back at her and drains the rest of his gin, watching with interest when she leans in to say something to her friends, before she wanders over toward him.</p><p>She is a sight as she walks across the pub. Her hips sway side-to-side slowly, the too-tall spiky heels on her feet forcing her to walk carefully across the sticky floor. Her dress swishes around her ankles and she looks like she is far too rich and far too important to be anywhere near here. </p><p>“Hello,” She says when she reaches him, extending her hand. “I’m Zari.” </p><p>Her accent is American which strikes him as odd considering where she is. It’s not that Yanks don’t make the trek out to Liverpool, they do, but not Yanks that look anything like her. </p><p>“John,” he replies, taking her hand and lifting it to his mouth to press a gentle kiss to her knuckles. “John Constantine.”</p><p>There’s a flicker of something in her eyes and he wonders if she recognizes his name. He does have a reputation as someone who has been around. In more ways than one.</p><p>“You want to get out of here?” Zari asks, getting straight to the point.</p><p>“Why not buy me a drink first, ey?” John laughs. He wonders if all Americans are so brasen. </p><p>“I think you’ve had enough, actually,” Zari replies, eyeing him. Her brown eyes glitter with amusement, a gentle smirk on her lips. She’s teasing him, but she’s also probably right. </p><p>“What about your mates?” John asks, nodding over to where a group of four women are watching them curiously. </p><p>“Who do you think put me up to this?” Zari answers. </p><p>“So it’s a game, then is it?” John queries. </p><p>“If you want to think of it like that, sure,” Zari replies. “It’s a game. One where we both win.” She gives him a once over, her gaze moving from his face, over his torso, and down further still. Her tongue darts out across her lips, the soft pink contrasting with the harsh red of her lipstick. </p><p>“Isn’t it a bit dangerous to pick up a stranger in a pub?” John asks. </p><p>“I don’t mind a little danger,” Zari says, her eyes moving back to his. </p><p>He weighs the pros and cons of taking her back to his place round the corner. At worst, she drugs him and steals one of his organs, maybe robs him blind. At best…he lets his eyes roam over her body again. <em> Well </em>, he supposes the pros outweigh the cons.</p><p>Thing is, he doesn’t want to make it too easy for her. Something tells him she doesn’t get rejected often and he’d like to leave an impression. </p><p>John reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his cigarettes, putting one into his mouth as if he’s mulling over her proposal. </p><p>“That’s a nasty habit,” Zari says.</p><p>“Aye, but I’ve a reputation for bein a bit nasty myself,” John replies, giving her a wink. </p><p>Zari smiles at that, stepping a little closer to him. </p><p>John fishes out his lighter, clicking open the lid. </p><p>“Don’t you dare light that ciggy in here, John Constantine,” the pub owner, Megs, shouts over the crowd. </p><p>John holds up his hands in mock surrender, his lighter disappearing from his palm with a flick of his wrist. “Alright, okay,” he says around the cigarette in his mouth. “Was just about to step outside.”</p><p>He wiggles his fingers at Zari when he catches her staring at where his lighter had just been. </p><p>She looks at him with some sick sense of excitement in her eyes. He remembers when he used to be excited about magic. Before he knew the cost.</p><p>“Lovely meeting you, lass,” he says, nodding at her before he turns and walks away. He doesn’t invite her to follow.</p><p>John is halfway through his second cigarette when she finds him just out front of the pub. </p><p>“You’re still here,” he says, like he’s surprised she followed him.</p><p>“Are you going to keep playing games or are you going to take me home?” Zari asks. She’s not slurring her words or swaying on her feet and her eyes are clear and alert. So he has to assume she’s completely sober which throws him for a moment because he is so very clearly not.</p><p>John takes a long drag from his cigarette, watching the red embers burn to ash. He flicks the butt onto the ground, grinding it beneath his heel even though he knows he smoked it all the way down to the filter with nothing left to burn.</p><p>“‘S sober lass like you doin tryin ta go home with the likes of me?” he asks because he’s curious why someone so prim and proper would want to follow him to ruin.</p><p>“We all have our vices,” she answers, not missing a beat. </p><p>John smiles at that, offering her his arm. “Come on then,” he says, before he can think better of it. “Mine’s only a few blocks away.”</p><p>She takes his arm and lets him lead her down the dimly lit street.</p>
                        <hr/><p>He doesn’t apologise for the mess and she doesn’t comment on it. Her eyes are on him from the second they walk through the door to his flat. </p><p>Zari pushes him against the wall closest to his door the second they’re inside. Like she can’t wait another second to touch him. She presses her lips to his, scraping her fingernails through his hair and it’s almost too much too quickly. </p><p>His brain is still muddled from the alcohol, his movements sloppy and sluggish and he’s sure his mouth still tastes like smoke, but she takes all of him. </p><p>Zari runs her hands up the front of his chest, undoing his tie in one quick motion before she starts on the buttons of his shirt. She moves her mouth away from his, kissing down his throat to his chest, chasing her fingers with kisses as she undresses him. </p><p>She makes it all the way down to his abdomen before making her way back up to push off both his coat and shirt. Zari tosses both to the floor, hiking up the skirt of her dress and sinking slowly down to her knees. She runs her hands up his thighs, her long fingernails catching against the smooth fabric of his trousers.</p><p>He watches her, his eyes half lidded. Everything has since turned yellowish at the edges, the way it does every time he’s proper drunk. When everything finally feels good and right and just hazy enough around the edges that reality feels dreamlike. </p><p>Zari presses her cheek against his hardening cock, nuzzling it through his trousers. </p><p>John gasps and shivers, burying one of his hands in Zari’s hair. </p><p>She leans up a little higher on her knees, undoing his trousers and tugging them down just enough to free his cock. Zari raises her gaze to his, reaching her hand up to help him tighten his grip on her hair. </p><p>“Condom?” she asks. </p><p>John reaches into the pocket of his trousers and pulls out a condom, handing it to her. She takes it without a word, rolling it down over his cock. </p><p>“Don’t be afraid to hurt me,” she says, looking up at him. “I’m nowhere near as fragile as you think I am.”</p><p>He wants to ask her what she could possibly mean by that, but he’s cut off by her sucking his cock into her mouth. She takes him in slow, her eyes on his watching for his reaction when she swallows him down completely. </p><p>Her throat spasms around the head of his cock and he sees her eyes start to water, but she doesn’t pull away. She rolls her tongue along the base of his shaft, pulling back just slightly before taking him in again. </p><p>John is transfixed, watching her bright red lips leave stains on the condom as she bobs her head. He tightens his grip on her hair, pulling a little at the ends until Zari moans gently, eyes rolling back in her head. His toes curl, the vibration of her moan sending shivers up his spine. </p><p>“Fuck,” John rasps, letting his head fall back against the wall as he gives into the sensation of her sucking him off. “You’re so bloody good at that.”</p><p>Zari grabs his other hand and buries it in her hair, encouraging him to thrust. She braces herself against his thighs, digging her fingernails into his flesh while she struggles to breathe and keep her gag reflex under control while John fucks her mouth.</p><p>He’s so close, every thought in his head zeroing in on one thing. The feeling of her mouth wrapped around him, of his cock growing ever harder the nearer he is to release. </p><p>“I’m—” he starts, only for Zari to bar his hips and stop him, releasing his cock with a wet pop.</p><p>John gasps, his eyes snapping open to look down at Zari questioningly. </p><p>She smiles, wiping the edges of her lips with her fingertips. They come away stained red from her lipstick and she wipes them on his hip, leaving red marks on his skin. She stands slowly, her body pressed flush against his. </p><p>“You didn’t think I’d make it that easy, did you?” she whispers in his ear, nipping at his earlobe. “We’re just getting started.”</p><p>She eases the condom off his cock and pulls away from him, wandering further into his flat. Zari wanders into his kitchen, tossing the condom into the bin. </p><p>John watches after her, still leaning against the wall for support. </p><p>Zari turns to look at him over her shoulder, reaching up to undo the tie at the back of her neck. The front of her gown falls down to her waist, fabric catching on her hips. She’s wearing nothing underneath, the skin of her back bare and unmarred. </p><p>She slips her fingers into the waist of the gown, easing it down over her hips to pool at her feet. Zari’s not wearing anything beneath that either. </p><p>John smiles.</p><p>“Well?” Zari asks, stepping out of her gown and leaving it there on his floor. “Are you going to stand there gaping at me or are you going to take me to bed?”</p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself, luv,” he says, pushing up from the wall and sauntering over to her like he’s completely in control of this situation. When in reality, he relinquished his power to her the second he offered her his arm outside of the pub. </p><p>She pins him down with her gaze, her eyes narrowing in a silent challenge. </p><p>He doesn’t hesitate to invade her space because like her, he has no sense of self-preservation. John doesn’t really care what happens to him so long as he can drag her down with him. </p><p>“You’re a strange man, John Constantine,” she says, turning slightly toward him when he stands at her back. </p><p>John reaches out and grabs her hips, keeping her facing away from him. “Aye, but you knew that, didn’t you?” he asks, brushing her hair away from the back of her neck and pressing soft kisses to her shoulder. “Why else would you be in that pub if you weren’t looking for someone like me?” </p><p>Zari sighs and leans her head back into him. “I could’ve just been hanging out with my friends, it’s not often the five of us get to spend time together.” </p><p>John hums, tracing his fingertips over her hip, up her side, over her ribs. “If that were true, wouldn’t you still be back at that pub with them?”</p><p>“Maybe I saw something I liked,” Zari answers.</p><p>He moves his other hand lower, burying his hand between her thighs. “You’re absolutely drenched, luv,” he whispers against her throat. “Did you like choking on my cock?”</p><p>John pushes one of his fingers inside of her, smirking when she gasps and shivers against him. </p><p>“Do you ever shut up?” she asks, turning her head to look at him out of the corner of her eye. </p><p>He quirks his finger inside of her, chuckling when she grabs his wrist and whines, her knees buckling. “If you didn’t want someone chatty, you took home the wrong stranger, sweetheart.”</p><p>She eases his hand from between her legs and turns to face him, a devilish smirk on her lips. “Oh, I bet I can shut you up.”</p><p>“I’d love to see you try.”</p><p>Zari grabs his hand and tugs him forward, walking across his place to the only other door in the room. She flings it open, navigating the mess that is his bedroom floor expertly in her too-high heels. </p><p>“Pants off,” she commands. </p><p>“Say please,” John quips, earning him an indignant glare. He loves the way she looks when she’s angry, a dangerous fire simmering just beneath the surface of her skin. John wants nothing more than to be caught up in that flame. </p><p>Burned from the inside out. </p><p>“<em> Now </em>,” she says instead of please. </p><p>He does what she asks anyway. </p><p>She pushes him down onto the bed, climbing on top of him until she’s sitting on his chest, her knees pinning down his arms. </p><p>“So this is how you’re gonna shut me up, hm?” John smirks. </p><p>“You can’t talk if your mouth’s full,” Zari says, spreading her legs a little wider and leaning up on her knees until she’s hovering over John’s mouth. </p><p>John laughs. “That only applies to people with manners, luv,” he breathes, nuzzling his face against her thigh. “You’ll find I don’t have any of those.” He wraps his arms around her thighs, burying his face in her cunt. </p><p>Zari sighs and scrapes her fingernails against his scalp again, rolling her hips against his mouth, chasing his tongue. </p><p>John spreads her open with his fingers, fucking her with his tongue. She’s so wet that his skin is drenched with her and he laps at her cunt greedily, craning his head up when she leans back to brace herself against his chest. </p><p>Zari rolls her hips against his mouth, sighing and moaning and digging her fingernails into his skin. </p><p>He moves his hands from her thighs, gripping her ass and pushing her harder against him until he can barely breathe beneath her. John sucks her clit into his mouth, circling it with his tongue until she’s pulling his hair so hard he sees stars. </p><p>When she’s so close she’s trembling, John pulls away, stilling her hips and smirking when he hears her growl in frustration. </p><p>“Turnabout,” John says, pressing a kiss to her thigh. </p><p>“You’re a bastard,” Zari pants. </p><p>“I know,” John purrs, wiping his mouth on her leg. </p><p>“You’re so smug,” Zari grouses, rolling her eyes and moving to lay on the bed next to him, staring up at the ceiling. She crosses her arms over her chest, so obviously annoyed with him.</p><p>John rolls on his side, resting his head on his hand. “Quite right,” he agrees. </p><p>“It’s no fun if you agree with every bad thing I think about you,” Zari snaps. </p><p>John hums noncommittally, leaning forward to press a kiss to her collarbone. He traces his fingertips in light circles against her hip bone, over her public mound and lower. Just low enough to make her spread her legs for him, a soft sigh escaping her lips. </p><p>He moves his hand back up to rest on her belly. </p><p>Zari makes a dissatisfied noise, closing her legs and squeezing her thighs together. </p><p>“Did you want me to touch you?” John asks, scraping his teeth against her pulse point. </p><p>Zari shivers. “You know I do,” she growls.</p><p>“Do I?” John queries, raising his head to look down at her. </p><p>Zari scowls up at him. </p><p>“Maybe I’ll be more inclined to give you what you want if you beg,” John whispers, nipping at the skin of her shoulder. </p><p>“I could leave,” Zari offers. “There are a hundred more men down at that pub that would give me what I want without being such a coy bastard about it.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you pick one of them then?” John asks, pressing his palm flat against her abdomen and sucking one of her nipples into his mouth. </p><p>Zari whines, squeezing her thighs together again. “I still could,” she gasps.</p><p>“By all means then, princess,” John says, leaning across her body to tease her other breast with his tongue. “I won’t stop you.”</p><p>Zari makes no move to leave, writhing beneath him while he rolls his tongue over her nipple, his hand moving lower on her belly again. </p><p>“Unless you want to say,” John whispers, his fingers tracing lightly over her thigh. Zari spreads her legs. “Because this is <em> actually </em>what you want.”</p><p>John traces his index finger over her cunt, his touch featherlight and teasing.</p><p>Zari gasps, raising her hips to chase his hand. John keeps his fingers just out of reach. </p><p>“You don’t want this to be too easy,” John tells her, moving his hand from between her legs to pinch and roll her nipple between his thumb and forefinger. “That’s why you’re still here, in my bed and not with any one of those other wankers from the pub.”</p><p>“Coulda had your pick of that lot,” John continues, gripping her chin and forcing her to look at him. “You chose me.”</p><p>Zari looks at him, her lips parted. Her pupils are blown wide, eyes glassy with need. </p><p>“I’ll ask again, luv,” John says, squeezing her chin a little tighter. “Do you want me to touch you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Zari answers. </p><p>“Then beg,” John commands. </p><p>Zari’s eyes flutter closed and she inhales sharply. “<em> Please </em>.” she whispers. </p><p>“Please what?” John prompts. </p><p>“Please touch me,” Zari gasps. </p><p>John releases her face and moves his hand between her legs. He circles her clit with his index finger, not quite touching it yet. “Do you want to cum?” he asks. </p><p>“<em> Please </em>,” Zari begs.</p><p>“You’re so close already,” John says, finally giving her what she so desperately wants. He presses his fingers against her, moving his hand in quick circles. </p><p>Zari arches up off the bed, her legs trembling, her hands grabbing at his sheets. </p><p>“I could stop right now,” John whispers, his fingers slowing a bit. “Like I did last time.”</p><p>Zari sobs, rocking her hips against his hand. “Please,” she begs him. “Please let me finish.”</p><p>“You didn’t let me finish,” John says, moving his fingers from her clit to press two of them inside of her. </p><p>Zari flops down on the bed, growling in frustration. She’s panting hard, her skin covered with a sheen of sweat. </p><p>“I hate you,” she gasps. </p><p>“Good,” John replies, rolling on top of her to bury his face between her legs again. He presses his lips to her swollen clit, sucking it into his mouth. </p><p>Zari’s hands go to his hair, her back arching against his mattress. </p><p>She screams when she comes, so loud the entire city of Liverpool probably hears her. She digs her fingernails so deeply into his scalp he’s sure he’s bleeding. </p><p>He eases off of her clit, working her through her orgasm with his tongue. John laps at her until she shoves his head away, closing her legs and breathing heavily. </p><p>“Worth the wait?” he asks, smug. </p><p>“Shut up,” Zari gasps. </p><p>“Make me,” John smirks. </p><p>Zari sighs. Her cheek is pressed against his mattress, her mouth open and gasping. She has her eyes shut tight, her hair a mess of black waves splayed out on the white fabric of his sheets. When she finally opens her eyes again to look at him, obviously catching the way he is unabashedly admiring her in the afterglow, she has a mischievous glint in her eyes. </p><p>“Okay,” she replies to his earlier challenge, rolling over on top of him. Her breathing is still labored, but her pupils are blown wide with arousal, the edges of her lips are turned up in a devious grin.</p><p>She leans across him, opening the drawer of his nightstand and fishing out a condom. Zari wastes no time rolling it down over his cock then gripping him at the base and easing him inside of her. </p><p>John moans, tilting his head back. </p><p>Zari clenches her inner walls around him and he gasps, grabbing her thighs and digging his fingernails into her skin. </p><p>“You’re still being so noisy,” Zari says, rolling her hips.</p><p>John groans, bucking up into her. </p><p>Zari tuts at him, pushing him back down against the bed. “Listen to you,” she says, gripping his wrists and pressing his arms over his head so she’s laying on top of him. “So loud.” She grinds against him, her thrusts shallow. </p><p>John sighs, frustrated. </p><p>“Are you really surprised?” She asks him. “After how you toyed with me? Did you think I wouldn’t return the favor?” </p><p>Zari rakes her fingernails over his wrists, down his arms to his shoulders. She kisses him sweetly, wrapping one of her hands around his throat. “I can play this game too.”</p><p>She pushes on his airway, arching back up to ride his cock properly. </p><p>John’s head spins, his breathing shallow and labored. He grabs her wrist, holding onto it tight, keeping it against his throat. </p><p>“Oh, do you like that?” Zari asks, squeezing harder. She quickens her pace, watching with a smirk when it gets harder and harder for him to catch his breath. </p><p>John’s chest burns and he knows it’s too much. She’s holding him too tight, but he doesn’t do anything to stop her. He just watches, letting her pull him down into ruin. Blackness eats at the edges of his vision and he lets his hand fall away from her wrist, eyes rolling back in his head. </p><p>Zari eases up on his throat before he can go under, leaning back and bracing herself on his knees. </p><p>He comes back into himself, gasping for breath. His vision clears and his ears start ringing, head muddled and dizzy. John looks down at her, watching her watch him with dark eyes while she bounces up and down on his cock. </p><p>“Again,” John croaks.</p><p>Zari leans forward, arching back over him, her hand pressing against his airway. She’s gentler this time, cutting his breath off just enough that it makes stars explode behind his eyelids. His chest doesn’t burn from lack of air, blackness doesn’t eat at his vision. </p><p>He’s ashamed by how much he misses the peaceful bliss of drifting off into nothing. </p><p>To be completely undone is a special kind of pleasure. </p><p>When he’s close, his muscles going taut, body spasming beneath her, he fully expects her to stop. To play the same game they’ve been playing. </p><p>She doesn’t. </p><p>Zari tightens her grip on his throat and fucks him harder. Her thrusts harsh and punishing. </p><p>His vision swims,  the whole world tilting and turning dreamlike from the lack of oxygen in his lungs. </p><p>“You’re so pretty like this,” she tells him. “So undone.”</p><p>John closes his eyes, his hands going to her hips. He makes a strangled sound. </p><p>“I know,” she whispers to his incoherent babbling, letting her fingernails bite into the skin of his throat. “Cum for me.”</p><p>John gasps, gripping her hips so hard he’s sure she’ll have bruises in the shape of his fingers there tomorrow. He arches up on the bed beneath her and she loses her grip on his neck, leaning back to fuck him through his orgasm. </p><p>He sucks in air greedily while he comes, his hips jerking against hers and throwing off her rhythm. His head is a wreck of nothing thoughts, his brain completely empty of everything but the feeling of her wrapped around him. </p><p>“Wow,” Zari says, peering down at him with a satisfied smirk on her lips. </p><p>John’s vision is still unfocused, but he can tell by the ‘wow’ she’s uttered that she’s <em> smug </em> and it’s probably what he deserves. Someone who gives as good as she gets.</p></div>
